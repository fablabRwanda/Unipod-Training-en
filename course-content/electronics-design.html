                                Welcome to Electronics Design! This week, you'll learn to design your own printed circuit boards (PCBs) using Electronic Design Automation (EDA) software. 
                                Whether you're building a sensor node for agriculture, a controller for a water pump, or a custom board for your final project, understanding PCB design 
                                is essential for creating reliable, professional electronics.

                                In many African contexts, importing ready-made development boards can be expensive and slow. By learning to design your own boards, you gain independence 
                                to create exactly what you need, using components available locally. We'll focus on practical skills: drawing schematics, routing traces, and preparing 
                                files for fabrication in your UNIPOD lab.
                            </p>

                                This week builds directly on Electronics Production (where you learned to mill and solder boards) and prepares you for Embedded Programming (where you'll 
                                write code for your custom hardware). By the end, you'll have designed a microcontroller board with at least one input and one output device, ready for 
                                fabrication and programming.

                            <p>
                                A schematic is a symbolic representation of your circuit. Unlike a physical layout, it shows <em>what</em> connects to <em>what</em>, not <em>where</em> 
                                components sit. Think of it as a map of electrical relationships. Common symbols include:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Microcontrollers</strong>: Represented as rectangles with labeled pins (VCC, GND, GPIO pins, etc.)</li>
                                <li><strong>Resistors</strong>: Zigzag lines or rectangles with values (e.g., 10kΩ, 220Ω)</li>
                                <li><strong>Capacitors</strong>: Parallel lines (polarized) or curved lines (non-polarized)</li>
                                <li><strong>Power symbols</strong>: VCC (positive), GND (ground), often shown as labels or symbols</li>
                                <li><strong>Connectors</strong>: Headers, USB ports, or other interfaces your board will use</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                When drawing schematics, always include a power supply section (voltage regulator, decoupling capacitors), a microcontroller section, and your 
                                input/output peripherals. Label everything clearly—future you will thank present you!
                            </p>

                            <h4 class="h5 mt-4">2. From Schematic to PCB Layout</h4>
                            <p>
                                Once your schematic is complete and passes ERC (Electrical Rule Check), you move to the board layout. Here, you place physical components and route 
                                copper traces between them. Key considerations:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Component placement</strong>: Group related components together. Keep power components away from sensitive analog circuits. Place connectors 
                                    near board edges for easy access.</li>
                                <li><strong>Trace width</strong>: Power traces (VCC, GND) should be wider (e.g., 0.5mm) than signal traces (0.2mm). This reduces resistance and 
                                    prevents voltage drops.</li>
                                <li><strong>Clearances</strong>: Maintain minimum spacing between traces (typically 0.2mm for 1/64" end mills). This prevents short circuits during 
                                    milling.</li>
                                <li><strong>Vias</strong>: Small holes plated with copper, used to route traces between layers. For single-layer boards (common in labs), avoid vias 
                                    or use wire jumpers.</li>
                                <li><strong>Ground planes</strong>: Large areas of copper connected to GND improve signal integrity and make routing easier. Fill unused space with 
                                    ground planes when possible.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4 class="h5 mt-4">3. Design Rules for Lab Fabrication</h4>
                            <p>
                                When designing for in-lab PCB milling (using machines like the SRM-20 or similar), you must account for the tool's limitations:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Minimum trace width</strong>: Typically 0.2mm (8 mils) for 1/64" end mills. Thinner traces may break during milling.</li>
                                <li><strong>Minimum clearance</strong>: 0.2mm between traces. Tighter spacing risks shorts.</li>
                                <li><strong>Via size</strong>: If using vias, make them at least 0.3mm diameter. Smaller vias are hard to drill reliably.</li>
                                <li><strong>Component spacing</strong>: Leave room for hand-soldering. SMD components need space for your iron tip.</li>
                                <li><strong>Text and labels</strong>: Use large, clear text (at least 1mm height) for component labels and board names.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                Most EDA tools have Design Rule Check (DRC) settings where you can configure these limits. Always run DRC before exporting fabrication files!
                            </p>

                            <h4 class="h5 mt-4">4. Component Selection for African Markets</h4>
                            <p>
                                When choosing components, consider:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Availability</strong>: Can you source this component locally or from regional suppliers? Check with your lab manager or local electronics 
                                    shops.</li>
                                <li><strong>Cost</strong>: Microcontrollers like ATtiny44/45 or ATmega328P are affordable and widely available. Avoid exotic or very new parts 
                                    unless necessary.</li>
                                <li><strong>Package type</strong>: Through-hole components are easier to solder by hand, but SMD (Surface Mount) parts are smaller and cheaper. 
                                    Start with through-hole if you're new to soldering.</li>
                                <li><strong>Voltage compatibility</strong>: Many African power systems use 12V or 24V. Design your board to accept a range of input voltages with 
                                    appropriate regulators (e.g., LM7805 for 5V, AMS1117 for 3.3V).</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                                <li>Run ERC (Electrical Rule Check) on your schematic—fix all errors</li>
                                <li>Run DRC (Design Rule Check) on your board layout—configure rules for your lab's milling capabilities</li>
                                <li>Export fabrication files (PNG for milling or Gerber files)</li>
                                <li>Document your component choices: Why did you choose these parts? Are they available locally? What was the cost?</li>

                            <h4 class="h5 mt-4">Group Assignment (Optional but Recommended)</h4>
                            <p>As a UNIPOD team, create a <strong>shared component library</strong>:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>List components that are readily available in your city/country</li>
                                <li>Include supplier names, approximate costs, and part numbers</li>
                                <li>Share EDA library files (KiCad libraries, Eagle libraries) for commonly used components</li>
                                <li>Document any substitutions you made (e.g., "We used LM7805 instead of AMS1117 because it's cheaper here")</li>
                            </ul>

                                <strong>Important:</strong> Your documentation should be clear enough that another student could reproduce your board design. Include enough detail 
                                that someone reading your page understands not just <em>what</em> you did, but <em>why</em> you made each design choice.

                                <li><strong>Start simple:</strong> Don't try to design a complex board on your first attempt. Begin with the LED controller example, then add features.</li>
                                <li><strong>Use existing designs as reference:</strong> Look at open-source PCB designs (on GitHub, Hackaday, etc.) to see how others solved similar problems.</li>
                                <li><strong>Test your schematic logic:</strong> Before routing, verify that your schematic makes sense. Does power flow correctly? Are all pins connected?</li>
                                <li><strong>Double-check pin assignments:</strong> Microcontroller pinouts can be confusing. Always verify pin numbers match between schematic and datasheet.</li>
                                <li><strong>Save frequently:</strong> EDA tools can crash. Save your work often and keep backup copies.</li>
                                <li><strong>Ask for help:</strong> If you're stuck, ask your lab manager or classmates. PCB design has many "gotchas" that experienced designers know about.</li>
                                <li><strong>Document as you go:</strong> Don't wait until the end to document. Take screenshots during the design process—they'll help you remember your thinking later.</li>
